 * struct cros_ec_device - Information about a ChromeOS EC device
 *
 * @phys_name: name of physical comms layer (e.g. 'i2c-4')
 * @dev: Device pointer for physical comms device
 * @was_wake_device: true if this device was set to wake the system from
 * sleep at the last suspend
 * @cmd_read_mem: direct read of the EC memory-mapped region, if supported
 *     @offset is within EC_LPC_ADDR_MEMMAP region.
 *     @bytes: number of bytes to read. zero means "read a string" (including
 *     the trailing '\0'). At most only EC_MEMMAP_SIZE bytes can be read.
 *     Caller must ensure that the buffer is large enough for the result when
 *     reading a string.
 *
 * @priv: Private data
 * @irq: Interrupt to use
 * @din: input buffer (for data from EC)
 * @dout: output buffer (for data to EC)
 * \note
 * These two buffers will always be dword-aligned and include enough
 * space for up to 7 word-alignment bytes also, so we can ensure that
 * the body of the message is always dword-aligned (64-bit).
 * We use this alignment to keep ARM and x86 happy. Probably word
 * alignment would be OK, there might be a small performance advantage
 * to using dword.
 * @din_size: size of din buffer to allocate (zero to use static din)
 * @dout_size: size of dout buffer to allocate (zero to use static dout)
 * @wake_enabled: true if this device can wake the system from sleep
 * @lock: one transaction at a time
 * @cmd_xfer: send command to EC and get response
 *     Returns the number of bytes received if the communication succeeded, but
 *     that doesn't mean the EC was happy with the command. The caller
 *     should check msg.result for the EC's result code.
