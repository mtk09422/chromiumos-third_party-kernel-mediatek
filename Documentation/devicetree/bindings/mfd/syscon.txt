* System Controller Registers R/W driver

System controller node represents a register region containing a set
of miscellaneous registers. The registers are not cohesive enough to
represent as any specific type of device. The typical use-case is for
some other node's driver, or platform-specific code, to acquire a
reference to the syscon node (e.g. by phandle, node path, or search
using a specific compatible value), interrogate the node (or associated
OS driver) to determine the location of the registers, and access the
registers directly.

Optionally, devices that are only controlled through single syscon
registers or bitfields can also be added as child nodes to the syscon
device node. These devices can implicitly assume their parent node
as syscon provider without referencing it explicitly via phandle.
In this case, the syscon node should have #address-cells = <1> and
#size-cells = <0> or <1> and no ranges property.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should contain "syscon".
- reg: the register region can be accessed from syscon

Examples:
gpr: iomuxc-gpr@020e0000 {
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;
	compatible = "fsl,imx6q-iomuxc-gpr", "syscon";
	reg = <0x020e0000 0x38>;
};
