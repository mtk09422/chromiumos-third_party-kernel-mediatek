* MTK MMC controller

The MTK  MSDC can act as a MMC controller
to support MMC, SD, and SDIO types of memory cards.

This file documents differences between the core properties in mmc.txt
and the properties used by the msdc driver.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "mediatek,mt8173-mmc","mediatek,mt8135-mmc".
- interrupts: Should contain MSDC interrupt number
- core-power-supply: power to the Core
- clocks: MSDC source clock
- clock-names: "source"
- pinctrl-names: should be "default", "state_uhs"
- pinctrl-0: should contain default/high speed pin ctrl
- pinctrl-1: should contain uhs mode pin ctrl

Optional properties:
- io-power-supply: power to the IO(for SD/SDIO)

Examples:
mmc0: mmc@11230000 {
	compatible = "mediatek,mt8173-mmc","mediatek,mt8135-mmc";
	reg = <0 0x11230000 0 0x108>;
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 39 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;
	core-power-supply = <&mt6397_vemc_3v3_reg>;
	clocks = <&pericfg PERI_MSDC20_1_CK>;
	clock-names = "source";
	pinctrl-names = "default", "state_uhs";
	pinctrl-0 = <&mmc0_pins_default>;
	pinctrl-1 = <&mmc0_pins_uhs>;
};
