Mediatek MT8135 Clock Controller

This binding uses the common clock binding:
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt

The Mediatek MT8135 clock controller generates and supplies clock to various
controllers within Mediatek MT8135 SoC.

Required Properties:

- compatible: should be one of following:
	- "mediatek,mt8135-topckgen" : for topckgen clock controller of MT8135.
	- "mediatek,mt8135-apmixedsys" : for apmixed_sys (PLLs) of MT8135.
	- "mediatek,mt8135-infracfg" : for infra_sys clock controller of MT8135.
	- "mediatek,mt8135-pericfg" : for peri_sys clock controller of MT8135.

- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
  region.

- #clock-cells: should be 1.

All available clocks are defined as preprocessor macros in
dt-bindings/clock/mt8135-clk.h header and can be used in device tree sources.

Example: I2C controller node that consumes the clock generated by the clock
  controller (refer to the standard clock bindings for information about
  "clocks" and "clock-names" properties):

	i2c0: i2c@1100d000 {
		compatible = "mediatek,mt8135-i2c", "mediatek,mt6589-i2c";
		reg = <0 0x1100d000 0 0x70>, <0 0x11000300 0 0x80>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 44 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;
		clock-div = <16>;
		clocks = <&pericfg PERI_I2C0_CK>, <&pericfg PERI_AP_DMA_CK>;
		clock-names = "main", "dma";
	};
