Binding for MT6397 clock driver

MT6397 clock is a sub-module of MT6397 multi-function device.
It contains clocks to support internal functions, such as i2c, audio, etc. It is
controlled over pmic wrapper.
More information of MT6397 MFD can be found in bindings/mfd/mt6397.txt file.

Following properties should be presend in main device node of the MFD chip.

Required properties:
- compatible: "mediatek,mt6397-clk"
- #clock-cells: it shall be set to 1.

Clocks are defined in dt-bindings/clock/mediatek,mt6397-clks.h
header and can be used in device tree sources.

Example: clock node of the MFD chip
	pmic {
		compatible = "mediatek,mt6397";

		mt6397clock: mt6397clock {
			compatible = "mediatek,mt6397-clk";
			#clock-cells = <1>;
		};
	};

Example: clock consumer node
	i2c4: i2c@11011000 {
		compatible = "mediatek,mt8135-i2c";
		mediatek,have-pmic;
		clocks = <&mt6397clock MT6397_WRPCKPDN_I2C0>;
		clock-names = "pmic";
	};
