* Mediatek's SPI controller

The Mediatek's SPI controller is used to interface with SPI devices.

Required properties:
  - compatible: value should be either of the following.
      (a) "mediatek,mt6577-spi", for spi compatible with mt6577 spi.
      (b) "mediatek,mt6589-spi", for spi compatible with mt6589 spi.
      (c) "mediatek,mt8127-spi", for spi compatible with mt8127 spi.
      (d) "mediatek,mt8135-spi", for spi compatible with mt8135 spi.
  - reg: physical base address of the controller and dma base, length of memory mapped
    region.
  - interrupts: interrupt number to the cpu.
  - cell-index: the index of the spi controller.
  - clocks: clock name from clock manager.

Optional properties:
  - spi-max-frequency: Definition as per
                     Documentation/devicetree/bindings/spi/spi-bus.txt

Example:

    spi@11016000 {
      compatible = "mediatek,mt6577-spi";
      reg = <0 0x11016000 0 0x1000>;
      interrupts = <GIC_SPI 78 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;
      cell-index = <0>;
      clocks = <&pericfg PERI_SPI1_CK>;
      clock-names = "peri_spi";
      #address-cells = <1>;
      #size-cells = <0>;
    };
